# JulesCord — Agent State File

> This file is your memory and your constitution. Read it completely at the start of every task. Update it completely before opening your PR. Never skip this step.

## Project Goal

Build **JulesCord** — a production-grade, complex Discord bot written in **Go**, with a **React + Tailwind web dashboard**, backed by **PostgreSQL**, with a REST API, real-time WebSocket features, and a clean command architecture. This is not a toy bot. It is a serious, modern, scalable application that improves every single iteration.

You are the sole developer. No human writes code. Every 15 minutes you receive this prompt, read this file, and implement the next set of tasks. The PR is auto-merged. You iterate forever.

## Architecture Rules — NEVER violate

1. **Never touch `.github/workflows/`** — automation handles itself
2. **Never hardcode secrets** — always environment variables
3. **Never push directly to main** — always open a PR
4. **Always update AGENTS.md** before opening a PR
5. **Never regress** — don't remove or break working features
6. **Write real, compiling Go code** — no pseudocode, no empty stubs
7. **One migration per phase** — never modify existing migration files, only add new ones
8. **PR title must start with `[Jules]`**
9. **Max 4 checklist items per iteration** — do them well, don't rush
10. **Frontend lives in `/web` only** — never mix frontend and backend

---

## Architecture Notes

- The Go binary runs two goroutines concurrently: Discord bot and Gin HTTP server
- React frontend is a separate Vite app in `/web`, served as static files in prod
- All Discord interactions go through the bot goroutine
- The REST API at `/api` is for the dashboard only
- WebSocket at `/ws` broadcasts real-time events to connected dashboard clients
- Use pgx connection pool — never open raw individual DB connections
- Slash commands are registered with Discord's REST API on every bot startup
- Use embeds for all Discord responses — never plain text

## Notes for Next Iteration

- Start Phase 1 completely: delete Node.js files, set up Go module, get bot connecting to Discord
- Get `/health` returning 200 from the API before anything else
- DB is optional in Phase 1 — skip if it blocks getting the bot online

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `BOT_TOKEN` | Discord bot token — this is the exact secret name, use it everywhere |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` | Discord application client ID for slash command registration |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `API_PORT` | Port for the Gin HTTP server (default 8080) |

**Important:** The token secret is named `BOT_TOKEN` — not `DISCORD_TOKEN`. Always use `BOT_TOKEN` in code and `.env.example`.

---

## Testing Requirements — MANDATORY

After every iteration that touches bot code, Jules MUST test before opening a PR.

### Steps

1. Build: `go build ./cmd/bot/` — must compile with zero errors
2. Run: `BOT_TOKEN=$BOT_TOKEN DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=$DISCORD_CLIENT_ID go run ./cmd/bot/` for 10 seconds
3. Verify the log contains a "Ready" / connected message
4. Verify slash commands were submitted to Discord REST API without error
5. Kill the process cleanly

The GitHub Actions runner has `BOT_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` available as environment variables from secrets. Jules can reference them directly when running the test.

**If the bot fails to start or slash commands fail to register — fix it before opening the PR.**
